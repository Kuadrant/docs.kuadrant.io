This is same behavior as the analogous problem with the Kuadrant AuthPolicy.</p> <p>To avoid these problems, use different hostnames in each route.</p>"},{"location":"kuadrant-operator/doc/rate-limiting/#implementation-details","title":"Implementation details","text":"<p>Driven by limitations related to how Istio injects configuration in the filter chains of the ingress gateways, Kuadrant relies on Envoy's Wasm Network filter in the data plane, to manage the integration with rate limiting service (\"Limitador\"), instead of the Rate Limit filter.</p> <p>Motivation: Multiple rate limit domains The first limitation comes from having only one filter chain per listener. This often leads to one single global rate limiting filter configuration per gateway, and therefore to a shared rate limit domain across applications and policies. Even though, in a rate limit filter, the triggering of rate limit calls, via actions to build so-called \"descriptors\", can be defined at the level of the virtual host and/or specific route rule, the overall rate limit configuration is only one, i.e., always the same rate limit domain for all calls to Limitador.</p> <p>On the other hand, the possibility to configure and invoke the rate limit service for multiple domains depending on the context allows to isolate groups of policy rules, as well as to optimize performance in the rate limit service, which can rely on the domain for indexation.</p> <p>Motivation: Fine-grained matching rules A second limitation of configuring the rate limit filter via Istio, particularly from Gateway API resources, is that rate limit descriptors at the level of a specific HTTP route rule require \"named routes\" \u2013 defined only in an Istio VirtualService resource and referred in an EnvoyFilter one. Because Gateway API HTTPRoute rules lack a \"name\" property<sup>1</sup>, as well as the Istio VirtualService resources are only ephemeral data structures handled by Istio in-memory in its implementation of gateway configuration for Gateway API, where the names of individual route rules are auto-generated and not referable by users in a policy<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>, rate limiting by attributes of the HTTP request (e.g., path, method, headers, etc) would be very limited while depending only on Envoy's Rate Limit filter.</p> <p>Motivated by the desire to support multiple rate limit domains per ingress gateway, as well as fine-grained HTTP route matching rules for rate limiting, Kuadrant implements a wasm-shim that handles the rules to invoke the rate limiting service, complying with Envoy's Rate Limit Service (RLS) protocol.</p> <p>The wasm module integrates with the gateway in the data plane via Wasm Network filter, and parses a configuration composed out of user-defined RateLimitPolicy resources by the Kuadrant control plane. Whereas the rate limiting service (\"Limitador\") remains an implementation of Envoy's RLS protocol, capable of being integrated directly via Rate Limit extension or by Kuadrant, via wasm module for the Istio Gateway API implementation.</p> <p>As a consequence of this design: - Users can define fine-grained rate limit rules that match their Gateway and HTTPRoute definitions including for subsections of these. - Rate limit definitions are insulated, not leaking across unrelated policies or applications. - Conditions to activate limits are evaluated in the context of the gateway process, reducing the gRPC calls to the external rate limiting service only to the cases where rate limit counters are known in advance to have to be checked/incremented. - The rate limiting service can rely on the indexation to look up for groups of limit definitions and counters. - Components remain compliant with industry protocols and flexible for different integration options.</p> <p>A Kuadrant wasm-shim configuration for 2 RateLimitPolicy custom resources (a Gateway default RateLimitPolicy and a HTTPRoute RateLimitPolicy) looks like the following and it is generated automatically by the Kuadrant control plane:</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1\nkind: WasmPlugin\nmetadata:\n  name: kuadrant-istio-ingressgateway\n  namespace: istio-system\n  \u2026\nspec:\n  phase: STATS\n  pluginConfig:\n    failureMode: deny\n    rateLimitPolicies:\n    -

To decide whether the route selector selects a HTTPRouteRule or not, for each pair of route selector HTTPRouteMatch and HTTPRoute HTTPRouteMatch: 1. The route selector selects the HTTPRoute's HTTPRouteRule if the HTTPRouteRule contains at least one HTTPRouteMatch that specifies fields that are literally identical to all the fields specified by at least one HTTPRouteMatch of the route selector. 2. A HTTPRouteMatch within a HTTPRouteRule may include other fields that are not specified in a route selector match, and yet the route selector match selects the HTTPRouteRule if all fields of the route selector match are identically included in the HTTPRouteRule's HTTPRouteMatch; the opposite is NOT true. 3. Each field <code>path</code> of a HTTPRouteMatch, as well as each field <code>method</code> of a HTTPRouteMatch, as well as each element of the fields <code>headers</code> and <code>queryParams</code> of a HTTPRouteMatch, is atomic \u2013 this is true for the HTTPRouteMatches within a HTTPRouteRule, as well as for HTTPRouteMatches of a route selector.</p> <p>Additionally, at least one hostname specified in a route selector must identically match one of the hostnames specified (or inherited, when omitted) by the targeted HTTPRoute.</p> <p>The semantics of the route selectors allows to assertively relate policy rule definitions to routing rules, with benefits for identifying the subsets of the network that are covered by a policy rule, while preventing unreachable definitions, as well as the overhead associated with the maintenance of such rules across multiple resources throughout time, according to network topology beneath. Moreover, the requirement of not having to be a full copy of the targeted HTTPRouteRule matches, but only partially identical, helps prevent repetition to some degree, as well as it enables to more easily define policy rules that scope across multiple HTTPRouteRules (by specifying less rules in the selector).</p>"},{"location":"kuadrant-operator/doc/reference/route-selectors/#golden-rules-and-corner-cases","title":"Golden rules and corner cases","text":"<p>A few rules and corner cases to keep in mind while using the RLP's <code>routeSelectors</code>: 1. The golden rule \u2013 The route selectors in a policy or policy rule are not to be interpreted as the route matching rules that activate the policy or policy rule, but as selectors of the route rules that activate the policy or policy rule. 2. Due to (1) above, this can lead to cases, e.g., where a route selector that states <code>matches: [{ method: POST }]</code> selects a HTTPRouteRule that defines <code>matches: [{ method: POST },  { method: GET }]</code>, effectively causing the policy or policy rule to be activated on requests to the HTTP method <code>POST</code>, but also to the HTTP method <code>GET</code>. 3. The requirement for the route selector match to state patterns that are identical to the patterns stated by the HTTPRouteRule (partially or entirely) makes, e.g., a route selector such as <code>matches: { path: { type: PathPrefix, value: /foo } }</code> to select a HTTPRouteRule that defines <code>matches: { path: { type: PathPrefix, value: /foo }, method: GET }</code>, but not to select a HTTPRouteRule that only defines <code>matches: { method: GET }</code>, even though the latter includes technically all HTTP paths; nor it selects a HTTPRouteRule that only defines <code>matches: { path: { type: Exact, value: /foo } }</code>, even though all requests to the exact path <code>/foo</code> are also technically requests to <code>/foo*</code>. 4. The atomicity property of fields of the route selectors makes, e.g., a route selector such as <code>matches: { path: { value: /foo } }</code> to select a HTTPRouteRule that defines <code>matches: { path: { value: /foo } }</code>, but not to select a HTTPRouteRule that only defines <code>matches: { path: { type: PathPrefix, value: /foo } }</code>. (This case may actually never happen because <code>PathPrefix</code> is the default value for <code>path.type</code> and will be set automatically by the Kubernetes API server.)</p> <p>Due to the nature of route selectors of defining pointers to HTTPRouteRules, the <code>routeSelectors</code> field is not supported in a RLP that targets a Gateway resource.</p>"},{"location":"kuadrant-operator/doc/reference/tlspolicy/","title":"The TLSPolicy Custom Resource Definition (CRD)","text":"<ul> <li>TLSPolicy</li> <li>TLSPolicySpec</li> <li>TLSPolicyStatus</li> </ul>"},{"location":"kuadrant-operator/doc/reference/tlspolicy/#tlspolicy","title":"TLSPolicy","text":"Field Type Required Description <code>spec</code> TLSPolicySpec Yes The specification for TLSPolicy custom resource <code>status</code> TLSPolicyStatus No The status for the custom resource"},{"location":"kuadrant-operator/doc/reference/tlspolicy/#tlspolicyspec","title":"TLSPolicySpec","text":"Field Type Required Description <code>targetRef</code> Gateway API PolicyTargetReference Yes Reference to a Kuberentes resource that the policy attaches to <code>issuerRef</code> CertManager meta/v1.ObjectReference Yes IssuerRef is a reference to the issuer for the created certificate <code>commonName</code> String No CommonName is a common name to be used on the created certificate <code>duration</code> Kubernetes meta/v1.Duration No The requested 'duration' (i.e. lifetime) of the created certificate. <code>renewBefore</code> Kubernetes meta/v1.Duration No How long before the currently issued certificate's expiry cert-manager should renew the certificate. <code>usages</code> []CertManager v1.KeyUsage No Usages is the set of x509 usages that are requested for the certificate.

It is strongly recommended that you leverage Envoy along side Authorino. That said, it is possible to use Authorino without Envoy.</p> <p>Authorino implements Envoy's external authorization gRPC protocol and therefore will accept any client request that complies.</p> <p>Authorino also provides a second interface for raw HTTP authorization, suitable for using with Kubernetes ValidatingWebhook and other integrations (e.g. other proxies).</p> <p>The only attribute of the authorization request that is strictly required is the host name. (See Host lookup for more information.) The other attributes, such as method, path, headers, etc, might as well be required, depending on each <code>AuthConfig</code>. In the case of the gRPC <code>CheckRequest</code> method, the host is supplied in <code>Attributes.Request.Http.Host</code> and alternatively in <code>Attributes.ContextExtensions[\"host\"]</code>. For raw HTTP authorization requests, the host must be supplied in <code>Host</code> HTTP header.</p> <p>Check out Kuadrant for easy-to-use Envoy and Authorino deployment &amp; configuration for API management use-cases, using Kubernetes Custom Resources.</p> Is Authorino an Identity Provider (IdP)? <p>No, Authorino is not an Identity Provider (IdP). Neither it is an auth server of any kind, such as an OAuth2 server, an OpenID Connect (OIDC) server, a Single Sign On (SSO) server.</p> <p>Authorino is not an identity broker either. It can verify access tokens from multiple trusted sources of identity and protocols, but it will not negotiate authentication flows for non-authenticated access requests. Some tricks nonetheless can be done, for example, to redirect unauthenticated users to a login page.</p> <p>For an excellent auth server that checks all the boxes above, check out Keycloak.</p> How does Authorino compare to Keycloak? <p>Keycloak is a proper auth server and identity provider (IdP). It offers a huge set of features for managing identities, identity sources with multiple user federation options, and a platform for authentication and authorization services.</p> <p>Keycloak exposes authenticators that implement protocols such as OpenID Connect. The is a one-time flow that establishes the delegation of power to a client, for a short period of time. To be consistent with Zero Trust security, you want a validator to verify the short-lived tokens in every request that tries to reach your protected service/resource. This step that will repeat everytime could save heavy looking up into big tables of tokens and leverage cached authorization policies for fast in-memory evaluation. This is where Authorino comes in.</p> <p>Authorino verifies and validates Keycloak-issued ID tokens. OpenID Connect Discovery is used to request and cache JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS), used to verify the signature of the tokens without having to contact again with the Keycloak server, or looking in a table of credentials. Moreover, user long-lived credentials are safe, rather than spread in hops across the network.</p> <p>You can also use Keycloak for storing auth-relevant resource metadata. These can be fetched by Authorino in request-time, to be combined into your authorization policies. See Keycloak Authorization Services and User-Managed Access (UMA) support, as well as Authorino UMA external metadata counter-part.</p> Why doesn't Authorino handle OAuth flows? <p>It has to do with trust. OAuth grants are supposed to be negotiated directly between whoever owns the long-lived credentials in one hand (user, service accounts), and the trustworthy auth server that receives those credentials \u2013 ideally with minimum number of hops in the middle \u2013 and exchanges them for short-lived access tokens, on the other end.</p> <p>There are use-cases for Authorino running in the edge (e.g. Edge Authentication Architecture and token normalization), but in most cases Authorino should be seen as a last-mile component that provides decoupled identity verification and authorization policy enforcement to protected services in request-time. In this sense, the OAuth grant is a pre-flight exchange that happens once and as direct and safe as possible, whereas auth enforcement is kept lightweight and efficient.</p> Where does Authorino store users and roles? <p>Authorino does not store users, roles, role bindings, access control lists, or any raw authorization data. Authorino handles policies, where even these policies can be stored elsewhere (as opposed to stated inline inside of an Authorino <code>AuthConfig</code> CR).</p> <p>Authorino evaluates policies for stateless authorization requests. Any additional context is either resolved from the provided payload or static definitions inside the policies. That includes extracting user information from a JWT or client TLS certificate, requesting user metadata from opaque authentication tokens (e.g. API keys) to the trusted sources actually storing that content, obtaining synchronous HTTP metadata from services, etc.</p> <p>In the case of authentication with API keys, as well as its derivative to model HTTP Basic Auth, user data are stored in Kubernetes <code>Secret</code>s. The secret's keys, annotations and labels are usually the structures used to organize the data that later a policy evaluated in Authorino may require. Strictly, those are not Authorino data structures.</p> Can't I just use Envoy JWT Authentication and RBAC filters? <p>Envoy's JWT Authentication works pretty much similar to Authorino's JOSE/JWT verification and validation for OpenID Connect. In both cases, the JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) to verify the JWTs are auto-loaded and cached to be used in request-time. Moreover, you can configure for details such as where to extract the JWT from the HTTP request (header, param or cookie) and do some cool tricks regarding how dynamic metadata based on JWT claims can be injected to consecutive filters in the chain.</p> <p>However, in terms of authorization, while Envoy's implementation essentially allows to check for the list of audiences (<code>aud</code> JWT claim), Authorino opens up for a lot more options such as pattern-matching rules with operators and conditionals, built-in OPA and other methods of evaluating authorization policies.</p> <p>Authorino also allows to combine JWT authentication with other types of authentication to support different sources of identity and groups of users such as API keys, Kubernetes tokens, OAuth opaque tokens , etc.</p> <p>In summary, Envoy's JWT Authentication and Envoy RBAC filter are excellent solutions for simple use-cases where JWTs from one single issuer is the only authentication method you are planning to support and limited to no authorization rules suffice. On the other hand, if you need to integrate more identity sources, different types of authentication, authorization policies, etc, you might to consider Authorino.</p> Should I use Authorino if I already have Istio configured? <p>Istio is a great solution for managing service meshes. It delivers an excellent platform with an interesting layer of abstraction on top of Envoy proxy's virtual omnipresence within the mesh.</p> <p>There are lots of similarities, but also complementarity between Authorino and Istio and Istio Authorization in special.</p> <p>Istio provides a simple way to enable features that are, in many cases, features of Envoy, such as authorization based on JWTs, authorization based on attributes of the request, and activation of external authorization services, without having to deal with complex Envoy config files. See Kuadrant for a similar approach, nonetheless leveraging features of Istio as well.</p> <p>Authorino is an Envoy-compatible external authorization service. One can use Authorino with or without Istio.</p> <p>In particular, Istio Authorization Policies can be seen, in terms of functionality and expressiveness, as a subset of one type of authorization policies supported by Authorino, the pattern-matching authorization policies. While Istio, however, is heavily focused on specific use cases of API Management, offering a relatively limited list of supported attribute conditions, Authorino is more generic, allowing to express authorization rules for a wider spectrum of use cases \u2013 ACLs, RBAC, ABAC, etc, pretty much counting on any attribute of the Envoy payload, identity object and external metadata available.</p> <p>Authorino also provides built-in OPA authorization, several other methods of authentication and identity verification (e.g. Kubernetes token validation, API key-based authentication, OAuth token introspection, OIDC-discoverable JWT verification, etc), and features like fetching of external metadata (HTTP services, OIDC userinfo, UMA resource data), token normalization, wristband tokens and dynamic responses. These all can be used independently or combined, in a simple and straightforward Kubernetes-native fashion.</p> <p>In summary, one might value Authorino when looking for a policy enforcer that offers:</p> <ol> <li>multiple supported methods and protocols for rather hybrid authentication, encompassing future and legacy auth needs;</li> <li>broader expressiveness and more functionalities for the authorization rules;</li> <li>authentication and authorization in one single declarative manifest;</li> <li>capability to fetch auth metadata from external sources on-the-fly;</li> <li>built-in OPA module;</li> <li>easy token normalization and/or aiming for Edge Authentication Architecture (EAA).</li> </ol> <p>The good news is that, if you have Istio configured, then you have Envoy and the whole platform for wiring Authorino up if you want to. \ud83d\ude09</p> Do I have to learn OPA/Rego language to use Authorino? <p>No, you do not. However, if you are comfortable with Rego from Open Policy Agent (OPA), there are some quite interesting things you can do in Authorino, just as you would in any OPA server or OPA plugin, but leveraging Authorino's built-in OPA module instead. Authorino's OPA module is compiled as part of Authorino's code directly from the Golang packages, and imposes no extra latency to the evaluation of your authorization policies. Even the policies themselves are pre-compiled in reconciliation-time, for fast evaluation afterwards, in request-time.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you do not want to learn Rego or in any case would like to combine it with declarative and Kubernetes-native authN/authZ spec for your services, Authorino does complement OPA with at least two other methods for expressing authorization policies \u2013 i.e. pattern-matching authorization and Kubernetes SubjectAccessReview, the latter allowing to rely completely on the Kubernetes RBAC.</p> <p>You break down, mix and combine these methods and technolgies in as many authorization policies as you want, potentially applying them according to specific conditions. Authorino will trigger the evaluation of concurrent policies in parallel, aborting the context if any of the processes denies access.</p> <p>Authorino also packages well-established industry standards and protocols for identity verification (JOSE/JWT validation, OAuth token introspection, Kubernetes TokenReview) and ad-hoc request-time metadata fetching (OIDC userinfo, User-Managed Access (UMA)), and corresponding layers of caching, without which such functionalities would have to be implemented by code.</p> Can I use Authorino to protect non-REST APIs? <p>Yes, you can. In principle, the API format (REST, gRPC, GraphQL, etc) should not matter for the authN/authZ enforcer. There are a couple points to consider though.</p> <p>While REST APIs are designed in a way that, in most cases, information usually needed for the evaluation of authorization policies are available in the metadata of the HTTP request (method, path, headers), other API formats quite often will require processing of the HTTP body. By default, Envoy's external authorization HTTP filter will not forward the body of the request to Authorino; to change that, enable the <code>with_request_body</code> option in the Envoy configuration for the external authorization filter. E.g.:</p> <pre><code>with_request_body:\n  max_request_bytes: 1024\n  allow_partial_message: true\n  pack_as_bytes: true\n</code></pre> <p>Additionally, when enabling the request body passed in the payload to Authorino, parsing of the content should be of concern as well. Authorino provides easy access to attributes of the HTTP request, parsed as part of the Authorization JSON, however the body of the request is passed as string and should be parsed by the user according to each case.</p> <p>Check out Authorino OPA authorization and the Rego Encoding functions for options to parse serialized JSON, YAML and URL-encoded params. For XML transformation, an external parsing service connected via Authorino's HTTP GET/GET-by-POST external metadata might be required.</p> Can I run Authorino other than on Kubernetes? <p>As of today, no, you cannot, or at least it wouldn't suit production requirements.</p> Do I have to be admin of the cluster to install Authorino? <p>To install the Authorino Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and to define cluster roles required by the Authorino service, admin privilege to the Kubernetes cluster is required. This step happens only once per cluster and is usually equivalent to installing the Authorino Operator.</p> <p>Thereafter, deploying instances of the Authorino service and applying <code>AuthConfig</code> custom resources to a namespace depend on the permissions set by the cluster administrator \u2013 either directly by editing the bindings in the cluster's RBAC, or via options of the operator. In most cases, developers will be granted permissions to create and manage <code>AuthConfig</code>s, and sometimes to deploy their own instances of Authorino.</p> Is it OK to store AuthN/AuthZ configs as Kubernetes objects? <p>Authorino's API checks all the bullets to be aggregated to the Kubernetes cluster APIs, and therefore using Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and the Operator pattern has always been an easy design decision.</p> <p>By merging the definitions of service authN/authZ to the control plane, Authorino <code>AuthConfig</code> resources can be thought as extensions of the specs of the desired state of services regarding the data flow security. The Authorino custom controllers, built-in into the authorization service, are the agents that read from that desired state and reconcile the processes operating in the data plane.</p> <p>Authorino is declarative and seamless for developers and cluster administrators managing the state of security of the applications running in the server, used to tools such as <code>kubectl</code>, the Kubernetes UI and its dashboards. Instead of learning about yet another configuration API format, Authorino users can jump straight to applying and editing YAML or JSON structures they already know, in a way that things such as <code>spec</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>namespace</code> and <code>labels</code> have the meaning they are expected to have, and docs are as close as <code>kubectl explain</code>. Moreover, Authorino does not pile up any other redundant layers of APIs, event-processing, RBAC, transformation and validation webhooks, etc. It is Kubernetes in its best.</p> <p>In terms of scale, Authorino <code>AuthConfig</code>s should grow proportionally to the number of protected services, virtually limited by nothing but the Kubernetes API data storage, while namespace division and label selectors help adjust horizontally and keep distributed.</p> <p>In other words, there are lots of benefits of using Kubernetes custom resources and custom controllers, and unless you are planning on bursting your server with more services than it can keep record, it is totally \ud83d\udc4d to store your AuthN/AuthZ configs as cluster API objects.</p> Can I use Authorino for rate limiting? <p>You can, but you shouldn't.

Read more about the topologies in the Topologies section below.</p> <p>Authorino is deployed using the Authorino Operator, from an <code>Authorino</code> Kubernetes custom resource. Then, from another kind of custom resource, the <code>AuthConfig</code> CRs, each Authorino instance reads and adds to the index the exact rules of authN/authZ to enforce for each protected host (\"index reconciliation\").</p> <p>Everything that the AuthConfig reconciler can fetch in reconciliation-time is stored in the index. This is the case of static parameters such as signing keys, authentication secrets and authorization policies from external policy registries.</p> <p><code>AuthConfig</code>s can refer to identity providers (IdP) and trusted auth servers whose access tokens will be accepted to authenticate to the protected host. Consumers obtain an authentication token (short-lived access token or long-lived API key) and send those in the requests to the protected service.</p> <p>When Authorino is triggered by Envoy via the gRPC interface, it starts evaluating the Auth Pipeline, i.e. it applies to the request the parameters to verify the identity and to enforce authorization, as found in the index for the requested host (See host lookup for details).</p> <p>Apart from static rules, these parameters can include instructions to contact online with external identity verifiers, external sources of metadata and policy decision points (PDPs).</p> <p>On every request, Authorino's \"working memory\" is called Authorization JSON, a data structure that holds information about the context (the HTTP request) and objects from each phase of the auth pipeline: i.e., authentication verification (phase i), ad-hoc metadata fetching (phase ii), authorization policy enforcement (phase iii), dynamic response (phase iv), and callbacks (phase v).

An identity verification/authentication feature usually refers to a functionality of Authorino such as the API key-based authentication, the validation of JWTs/OIDC ID tokens, and authentication based on Kubernetes TokenReviews. Analogously, OPA, pattern-matching and Kubernetes SubjectAccessReview are examples of authorization features of Authorino.</p> <p>At a deeper level, a feature can also be an additional functionality within a bigger feature, usually applicable to the whole class the bigger feature belongs to. For instance, the configuration of how auth credentials expected to be carried in the request, which is broadly available for any identity verification method.

Consequently, different evaluator configs can use the same cache key and there will be no collision between entries from different evaluators.</p> <p>E.g.:</p> <pre><code>spec:\n  hosts:\n  - my-api.io\n\n  authentication: [\u2026]\n\n  metadata:\n    \"external-metadata\":\n      http:\n        url: http://my-external-source?search={context.request.http.path}\n      cache:\n        key:\n          selector: context.request.http.path\n        ttl: 300\n\n  authorization:\n    \"complex-policy\":\n      opa:\n        externalPolicy:\n          url: http://my-policy-registry\n      cache:\n        key:\n          selector: \"{auth.identity.group}-{context.request.http.method}-{context.request.http.path}\"\n        ttl: 60\n</code></pre> <p>The example above sets caching for the 'external-metadata' metadata config and for the 'complex-policy' authorization policy. In the case of 'external-metadata', the cache key is the path of the original HTTP request being authorized by Authorino (fetched dynamically from the Authorization JSON); i.e., after obtaining a metadata object from the external source for a given contextual HTTP path one first time, whenever that same HTTP path repeats in a subsequent request, Authorino will use the cached object instead of sending a request again to the external source of metadata. After 5 minutes (300 seconds), the cache entry will expire and Authorino will fetch again from the source if requested.</p> <p>As for the 'complex-policy' authorization policy, the cache key is a string composed the 'group' the identity belongs to, the method of the HTTP request and the path of the HTTP request. Whenever these repeat, Authorino will use the result of the policy that was evaluated and cached priorly. Cache entries in this namespace expire after 60 seconds.</p> <p>Notes on evaluator caching</p> <p>Capacity - By default, each cache namespace is limited to 1 mb. Entries will be evicted following First-In-First-Out (FIFO) policy to release space. The individual capacity of cache namespaces is set at the level of the Authorino instance (via <code>--evaluator-cache-size</code> command-line flag or <code>spec.evaluatorCacheSize</code> field of the <code>Authorino</code> CR).</p> <p>Usage - Avoid caching objects whose evaluation is considered to be relatively cheap. Examples of operations associated to Authorino auth features that are usually NOT worth caching: validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Kubernetes TokenReviews and SubjectAccessReviews, API key validation, simple JSON pattern-matching authorization rules, simple OPA policies. Examples of operations where caching may be desired: OAuth2 token introspection, fetching of metadata from external sources (via HTTP request), complex OPA policies.</p>"},{"location":"authorino/docs/features/#common-feature-metrics-metrics","title":"Common feature: Metrics (<code>metrics</code>)","text":"<p>By default, Authorino will only export metrics down to the level of the AuthConfig.

it is where the auth system is configured.</p> <p>Policy Decision Point (PDP) Where the authorization requests are sent, with permissions being requested, and authorization policies are evaluated accordingly.</p> <p>Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) Where the authorization is effectively enforced, usually at the resource server or at a proxy, based on a response provided by the Policy Decision Point (PDP).</p> <p>Policy storage Where policies are stored and from where they can be fetched, perhaps to be cached.</p> <p>Red Hat SSO Auth server;

essentially, roles represent collections of permissions</p> <p>Role-based Access Control (RBAC) Authorization model that grants/denies access to resources based on the roles of authenticated users (rather than on complex attributes/policy rules).</p> <p>Scope Mechanism that defines the specific operations that applications can be allowed to do or information that they can request on an identity\u2019s behalf; often presented as a parameter when access is requested as a way to communicate what access is needed, and used by auth server to respond what actual access is granted.</p> <p>Single Page Application (SPA) Web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server.</p> <p>Single Sign-on (SSO) Authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.</p> <p>Upstream (In the context of authentication/authorization) API whose endpoints must be protected by the auth system; the unprotected service in front of which a protection layer is added (by connecting with a Policy Decision Point).</p> <p>User-based Access Control (UBAC) Authorization model that grants/denies access to resources based on claims of the identity (attributes of the user).</p> <p>User-Managed Access (UMA) OAuth2-based access management protocol, used for users of an auth server to control the authorization process, i.e. directly granting/denying access to user-owned resources to other requesting parties.</p>"},{"location":"authorino/docs/user-guides/","title":"User guides","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Hello World The basics of protecting an API with Authorino.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication with Kubernetes tokens (TokenReview API) Validate Kubernetes Service Account tokens to authenticate requests to your protected hosts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication with API keys Issue API keys stored in Kubernetes <code>Secret</code>s for clients to authenticate with your protected hosts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication with X.509 certificates and mTLS Verify client X.509 certificates against trusted root CAs.</p> </li> <li> <p>OpenID Connect Discovery and authentication with JWTs Validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) issued and signed by an OpenID Connect server;

As for the users authenticating with API key, they are all bound to the <code>admin</code> role.</p> <p>Without normalizing identity claims from these two different sources, the policy would have to handle the differences of data formats with additional ifs-and-elses. Instead, the config here uses the <code>identity.extendedProperties</code> option to ensure a custom <code>roles</code> (Array) claim is always present in the identity object. In the case of Keycloak ID tokens, the value is extracted from the <code>realm_access.roles</code> claim; for API key-resolved objects, the custom claim is set to the static value <code>[\"admin\"]</code>.</p> Kuadrant users \u2013         Remember to create an <code>AuthPolicy</code> instead of an AuthConfig.

The namespace for the descriptors is defined by the <code>domain</code> field whereas for the rate limit configuration the <code>namespace</code> field is being used. For each matching counter, the counter is increased and the limits checked.</p> <p>One example to illustrate:</p> <p>Let's say we have 1 rate limit configuration (one counter per config):</p> <pre><code>conditions: [\"KEY_A == 'VALUE_A'\"]\nmax_value: 1\nseconds: 60\nvariables: []\nnamespace: example.org\n</code></pre> <p>Limitador receives one descriptor with two entries:</p> <pre><code>domain: example.org\ndescriptors:\n  - entries:\n    - KEY_A: VALUE_A\n    - OTHER_KEY: OTHER_VALUE\n</code></pre> <p>The counter's condition will match. Then, the counter will be increased and the limit checked. If the limit is exceeded, the request will be rejected with <code>429 Too Many Requests</code>, otherwise accepted.</p> <p>Note that the counter is being activated even though it does not match all the entries of the descriptor. The same rule applies for the variables field.</p> <p>Currently, the implementation of condition only allow for equal (<code>==</code>) and not equal (<code>!=</code>) operators. More operators will be implemented based off the use cases for them.</p> <p>The variables field is a list of keys. The matching rule is defined just as the existence of the list of descriptor entries with the same key values. If variables is <code>variables: [A, B, C]</code>, one descriptor matches if it has at least three entries with the same A, B, C keys.</p> <p>Few examples to illustrate.</p> <p>Having the following descriptors:</p> <pre><code>domain: example.org\ndescriptors:\n  - entries:\n    - KEY_A: VALUE_A\n    - OTHER_KEY: OTHER_VALUE\n</code></pre> <p>the following counters would not be activated.</p> <p><pre><code>conditions: [\"KEY_B == 'VALUE_B'\"]\nmax_value: 1\nseconds: 60\nvariables: []\nnamespace: example.org\n</code></pre> Reason: conditions key does not exist</p> <p><pre><code>conditions:\n  - \"KEY_A == 'VALUE_A'\"\n  - \"OTHER_KEY == 'WRONG_VALUE'\"\nmax_value: 1\nseconds: 60\nvariables: []\nnamespace: example.org\n</code></pre> Reason: not all the conditions match</p> <p><pre><code>conditions: []\nmax_value: 1\nseconds: 60\nvariables: [\"MY_VAR\"]\nnamespace: example.org\n</code></pre> Reason: the variable name does not exist</p> <p><pre><code>conditions: [\"KEY_B == 'VALUE_B'\"]\nmax_value: 1\nseconds: 60\nvariables: [\"MY_VAR\"]\nnamespace: example.org\n</code></pre> Reason: Both variables and conditions must match.

The idea is to improve throughput and latencies by caching the counters in memory to reduce the number of accesses to Redis. To achieve that, this mode sacrifices some rate-limit accuracy. This mode does two things:<ul> <li>Batches counter updates. Instead of updating the counters on every request, it updates them in memory and commits them to Redis in batches. The flushing interval can be configured with the <code>REDIS_LOCAL_CACHE_FLUSHING_PERIOD_MS</code> env. The trade-off is that when running several instances of Limitador, other instances will not become aware of the counter updates until they're committed to Redis.</li> <li>Caches counters. Instead of fetching the value of a counter every time it's needed, the value is cached for a configurable period. The trade-off is that when running several instances of Limitador, an instance will not become aware of the counter updates other instances do while the value is cached. When a counter is already at 0 (limit exceeded), it's cached until it expires in Redis. In this case, no matter what other instances do, we know that the quota will not be reestablished until the key expires in Redis, so in this case, rate-limit accuracy is not affected. When a counter has still some quota remaining the situation is different, that's why we can tune for how long it will be cached. The formula is as follows: MIN(ttl_in_redis/<code>REDIS_LOCAL_CACHE_TTL_RATIO_CACHED_COUNTERS</code>, <code>REDIS_LOCAL_CACHE_MAX_TTL_CACHED_COUNTERS_MS</code>). For example, let's image that the current TTL (time remaining until the limit resets) in Redis for a counter is 10 seconds, and we set the ratio to 2, and the max time for 30s. In this case, the counter will be cached for 5s (min(10/2, 30)). During those 5s, Limitador will not fetch the value of that counter from Redis, so it will answer faster, but it will also miss the updates done by other instances, so it can go over the limits in that 5s interval.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Optional.

Our default policy will execute a \"Round Robin\" weighted strategy which reflects the current default behaviour.</p> <p>With the above API we can provide weighted and GEO and weighted within a GEO. A weighted strategy with a minimum of a default weight is always required and the simplest type of policy. The multi-cluster gateway controller will set up a default policy when a gateway is discovered (shown below). This policy can be replaced or modified by the user.  A weighted strategy can be complimented with a GEO strategy IE they can be used together in order to provide a GEO and weighted (within a GEO) load balancing.

This information is useful at the control plane level. For example, a DNS Record should only exist as long as there is at least 1 attached route for a listener. It can also be more complicated than that when it comes to multi cluster gateways. A DNS Record should only include the IP Addresses of the Gateway instances where the listener has at least 1 attached route. This is important when initial setup of DNS Records happen as applications start. It doesn't make sense to route traffic to a Gateway where a listener isn't ready/attached yet.

For the other cases where a limit definition still fails to select an HTTPRouteRule (e.g. due to mismatching trigger matches), the limit definition is not considered invalid.

This lack of consistency has a direct impact on the overhead faced by users to learn how to interact with Kuadrant and write different kinds of policies, as well as for the maintainers on tasks of coding for policy validation and reconciliation of data plane configurations.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/rfcs/0002-well-known-attributes/#prior-art","title":"Prior art","text":"<p>Authorino's dynamic JSON paths, related to Authorino's Authorization JSON and used in <code>when</code> conditions and inside of multiple other constructs of the AuthConfig, are an example of feature of very similar approach to the one proposed here.</p> <p>Arguably, Authorino's perceived flexibility would not have been possible with the Authorization JSON selectors. Users can write quite sophisticated policy rules (conditions, variable references, etc) by leveraging the those dynamic selectors. Because they are backed by JSON-based machinery in the code, Authorino's selectors have very little to, in some cases, none at all variation compared Open Policy Agent's Rego policy language, which is often used side by side in the same AuthConfigs.</p> <p>Authorino's Authorization JSON selectors are, in one hand, more restrict to the structure of the <code>CheckRequest</code> payload (<code>context.*</code> attributes). At the same time, they are very open in the part associated with the internal attributes built along the Auth Pipeline (i.e. <code>auth.*</code> attributes). That makes Authorino's Authorization JSON selectors more limited, compared to the Envoy attributes made available to the wasm-shim via ABI, but also harder to validate. In some cases, such as of deep references to inside objects fetched from external sources of metadata, resolved OPA objects, JWT claims, etc, it is impossible to validate for correct references.</p> <p>Another experience learned from Authorino's Authorization JSON selectors is that they depend substantially on the so-called \"modifiers\". Many use cases involving parsing and breaking down attributes that are originally available in a more complex form would not be possible without the modifiers. Examples of such cases are: extracting portions of the path and/or query string parameters (e.g. collection and resource identifiers), applying translations on HTTP verbs into corresponding operations, base64-decoding values from the context HTTP request, amongst several others.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/rfcs/0002-well-known-attributes/#unresolved-questions","title":"Unresolved questions","text":"<ol> <li> <p>How to deal with the differences regarding the availability and data types of the attributes across clients/hosts?</p> </li> <li> <p>Can we make more attributes that are currently available to only one of the components common to both?</p> </li> <li> <p>Will we need some kind of global support for modifiers (functions) in the well-known selectors or those can continue to be an Authorino-only feature?</p> </li> <li> <p>Does Authorino, which is more strict regarding the data structure that induces the selectors, need to implement this specification or could/should it keep its current selectors and a translation be performed by the AuthPolicy controller?</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"architecture/rfcs/0002-well-known-attributes/#future-possibilities","title":"Future possibilities","text":"<ol> <li>Extend with more well-known attributes that abstract common patterns and/or for rather opinioned use cases.

A weighted strategy with a minimum of a default weight is always required and the simplest type of policy. The multi-cluster gateway controller will set up a default policy when a gateway is discovered (shown below). This policy can be replaced or modified by the user.  A weighted strategy can be complimented with a GEO strategy IE they can be used together in order to provide a GEO and weighted (within a GEO) load balancing.

This could be either condition's failed/error   state or a top-level condition.   * `Updated`: From `Failed` or `Applied`, it could be triggered a `Spec Change` event that would move it to this state.    **Stage 2: Further reconciliation check provides a new state**    This following one, besides checking what the former stage does, it also adds the states reflecting the reconciliation   process of any needed Kubernets object, Kuadrant Services custom resources and any other 3rd party CR required.

Allowing derivative resources (e.g. Authorino AuthConfigs) to reference objects across namespaces, as well as giving permissions to the components that process those references (e.g. Authorino) to read across namespaces    - May raise security concerns    - Should probably be restricted to derivative resources created by Kuadrant and not allowed to users who create the derivative resources themselves</p>"},{"location":"architecture/rfcs/0009-defaults-and-overrides/#policy-spec-resembling-more-the-target-spec","title":"Policy spec resembling more the target spec","text":"<p>Should Kuadrant's inherited policy specs resemble more the specs of the objects they target?</p> <p>The UX for one who writes a Kuadrant policy of the inherited class of policies is arguably not very different from writing any custom resource that happens to specify a <code>targetRef</code> field. Other than name and kind of target object, there is nothing much in a Kuadrant policy custom resource that provides the user with an experience almost close to be \"adding fields\" in the target object.</p> <p>With the exception of a few types reused for the route selectors, the spec of a Kuadrant policy is very different from the spec of the object that ultimately the policy augments, i.e. the spec of the route object. This remains basically unchanged after this RFC. However, another way to think on the design of those APIs is one where, in contrast, the specs of the policies partially mirror the spec of the route, so users can write policies in a more intuitive fashion, as if the definitions of the policy would look like extensions of the routes they target (directly or by targeting gateways the routes are attached to.)</p> <p>E.g.:</p> <pre><code>kind: HTTPRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: my-route\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - name: rule-1\n    matches:\n    - method: GET\n    backendRef: {\u2026}\n  - name: rule-2\n    backendRef: {\u2026}\n</code></pre> <p>An inherited policy that targets the HTTPRoute above could otherwise look like the following:</p> <pre><code>kind: Policy\nmetadata:\n  name: my-policy\nspec:\n  targetRef:\n    kind: HTTPRoute\n    name: my-route\n  defaults: # mirrors the spec of the httproute object\n    policySpecificDef: {\u2026} # augments the entire httproute object\n  overrides: # mirrors the spec of the httproute object\n    rules:\n    - name: rule-2\n      policySpecificDef: {\u2026} # augments only httprouterule rule-2 of the httproute object\n</code></pre> <p>The above already is somewhat closer to being true for the AuthPolicy API, than it is for the RateLimitPolicy one. However, that is strictly coincidental, because the AuthPolicy's spec happens to specify a <code>rules</code> field, where the equivalent at the same level in RateLimitPolicy is called <code>limits</code>.</p> <p>This alternative design could make writing policies more like defining filters in an HTTPRoute, with the difference that policies are external to the target they extend (while filters are internal.) At the same time, it could be a replacement for Kuadrant route selectors, where the context of applicability of a policy rule is given by the very structure within the spec how the policy rule is declared (resembling the one of the target), thus also would shaping context for D/O.</p> <p>One caveat of this design though is that each policy specific definition (i.e. the rule specification that extends the object at a given point defined by the very structure of the spec) is exclusive of that given point in the structure of the object. I.e., one cannot specify a single policy rule that augments N &gt; 1 specific rules of a target HTTPRoute.</p> <p>Due to its relevance to the design of the API that enables D/O, this was left as an unresolved question. To be nonetheless noticed that, as a pattern, this alternative API design extends beyond inherited policies, impacting as well the direct policy kinds DNSPolicy and TLSPolicy.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/rfcs/0009-defaults-and-overrides/#future-possibilities","title":"Future possibilities","text":""},{"location":"architecture/rfcs/0009-defaults-and-overrides/#n1-policy-target-relationship","title":"N:1 policy-target relationship","text":"<p>Although this proposal was thought to keep options open for multiple policies of a kind targeting a same network resource, this is currently not the state of things for Kuadrant.
